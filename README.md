### Objective

The player attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.

### Card Values

- Face cards (J, Q, K) count as 10
- 2 to 10 count as face value
- Ace can count as 1 or 11 depending on which value helps the hand the most

### The Deal

The player receives two cards face up and the dealer receives one card face up and one card face down.

### The Play

The player goes first and must decide whether to stand (not ask for another card) or hit (ask for another card). The player can continue to ask for a card one at a time until deciding to stand on the total. If the player goes over 21, the dealer wins.

### The Dealer's Play

Once the player stands, the dealers face-down card is turned up. If the total is 17 or more, the dealer will stand. If the total is 16 or less, the dealer will take a card. The dealer must continue to take a card until the total is 17 or more. Once the dealer's play is completed, the player wins if their total is greater than the dealer's total. If the player and dealer have the same total, the game is tied (push).
